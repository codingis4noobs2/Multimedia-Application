# Multimedia-Application

Certainly! Here's a revised version of the write-up:

**Feature Description:**

The two features added to the Multimedia Web App are a search functionality and a filter functionality.

1. **Search Functionality:** The search functionality allows users to search for specific files by their name. As users type in the search input, the file list is dynamically filtered to display only the files that match the search query. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial names as well. This feature provides users with a convenient way to locate specific files within a large collection, enhancing the overall usability of the app.

2. **Filter Functionality:** The filter functionality enables users to filter files by their type, such as videos, audios, images, or documents. By clicking on the corresponding filter buttons, the file list is updated to show only the files of the selected type. This feature allows users to focus on specific types of media files, making it easier to navigate through the collection and find the desired files.

**Reason for Choosing these Features:**

These two features were chosen because they greatly improve the user experience and efficiency of the Multimedia Web App:

1. The search functionality allows users to quickly locate specific files based on their names. In a multimedia collection with numerous files, this feature saves time and effort by eliminating the need to manually scroll or navigate through the entire list. It caters to users who have a specific file in mind and want to find it swiftly.

2. The filter functionality provides users with the ability to narrow down the file list based on file types. This feature is particularly useful when users want to focus on specific media types, such as videos or images, and exclude other types from view. It simplifies the browsing process, enhances organization, and improves the accessibility of files.

**Code Explanation:**

The code initializes state variables, including `myFiles`, `originalFiles`, `selectedFile`, `filePath`, `showChartModal`, `searchQuery`, and `activeFilter`. The `myFiles` state holds the current list of files displayed to the user, while `originalFiles` stores the original unfiltered list. `selectedFile` keeps track of the currently selected file, and `filePath` stores the base path for file URLs. The `showChartModal` state controls the visibility of the file breakdown chart modal.

The `handleSearch` function filters the `originalFiles` based on the search query entered by the user. It updates the `myFiles` state accordingly. When the search query is empty, the `myFiles` state is set back to the `originalFiles`, ensuring that the complete file list is displayed.

The `handleFilter` function filters the files based on the selected filter type (video, audio, image, or document). It updates the `myFiles` state to show only the files of the selected type. The active filter is stored in the `activeFilter` state.

The JSX code renders the search input, filter buttons, file list based on `myFiles`, and conditional components based on the selected file. The file breakdown chart modal is displayed when `showChartModal` is `true`. The UI layout and styles follow best practices to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.

These features enhance the Multimedia Web App by providing efficient search and filtering capabilities, allowing users to easily locate and browse through their desired files based on names and types.
